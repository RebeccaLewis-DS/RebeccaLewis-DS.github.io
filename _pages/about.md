Welcome to my page!  I am Rebecca Lewis and a resident of the beautiful area of Southeast Louisiana.  This site is a labor of love as a result of my participation Bellevue University's Master of Data Science Program.  I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Southestern Louisiana University in 2001.  

In between my degrees, I have lived life to the fullest and explored many different career paths.  I started my professional life at a Salon & Spa Software company, starting at tech support.  I worked my way through many positions including quality assurance, programming, reports development, and account management. After about 10 years, I decided to try something new and worked as a Franchise Consultant; however, my technical skillset made me a perfect fit to head their software conversion project.  I worked with the vendor to develop training manuals and webinars, create the upgrade schedule and support our franchises. In 2010, I noticed a posting for a position at the Louisiana SPCA for a Development associate to manage their donor database. I have alwasy loved and owned animals anc ould not pass up an opportunity to join my passion and my skillset. While I was at the Louisiana SPCA, I noticed the many different points at which we collected information from our supporters and wondered what sort of insights we could gain from the data to improve our impact. My curiosity led me to research data science and the rest is history.

While I am no longer at the Louisiana SPCA, the organization and mission remains close to my heart so you will find many projects in my portfolio centered around animal welfare.  Currently, I am a Data Solutions Architect at North Oaks Health System where I am able to use my skills to impact the lives of people. One day, I'd love to apply what I've learned about data science and analytics on a real world animal welfare problem.  If you have any ideas for a future project, please visit the [!][Contact](https://rebeccalewis-ds.github.io/contact/) page.

Besides work and education, I have a beautiful blended family with two adult stepdaughters, one teenage stepson, and a 6 year old son.  As you may be able to guess, we have a house full of animals including 3 dogs, 1 cat, and a bearded dragon named Gecko. In my free time, I love to workout, do crafts, and spend time watching my son at the ball park. I am lookin forward to reading books for fun again! I am a recent breast cancer survivor and am truly lucky to have been able to complete my master's degree and treatment at the same time. I'm currently healthy and getting my life back to better than normal!
