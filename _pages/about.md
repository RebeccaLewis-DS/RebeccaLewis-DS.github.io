Welcome to my page!  I am Rebecca Lewis and a resident of the beautiful area of Southeast Louisiana.  This site is a labor of love as a result of my participation Bellevue University's Master of Data Science Program.  I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Southestern Louisiana University in 2001.  

In between my degrees, I have lived life to the fullest and explored many different career paths.  I started my professional life at a Salon & Spa Software company, starting at tech support.  I worked my way through many positions including quality assurance, programming, reports development, and account management. After about 10 years, I decided to try something new and worked as a Franchise Consultant; however, my technical skillset made me a perfect fit to head their software conversion project.  I worked with the vendor to develop training manuals and webinars, create the upgrade schedule and support our franchises. In 2010, I noticed a posting for a position at the Louisiana SPCA for a Development associate to manage their donor database. I have alwasy loved and owned animals anc ould not pass up an opportunity to join my passion and my skillset. While I was at the Louisiana SPCA, I noticed the many different points at which we collected information from our supportes and wondered what sort of insights we could gain from the data to improve our impact.
