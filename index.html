Allow me to fan my feathers and show off the work I have completed as part of my Data Science education.  From 2018-2021, I studied as part of the Masters of Data Science program at Bellvue University completing multiple project demonstrating my abilities in Data Science including research, data wrangling, statistical modeling and presentation.
