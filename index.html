From 2018-2021, I studied as part of the Masters of Data Science program at Bellevue University completing multiple projects demonstrating my abilities in Data Science including research, data wrangling, statistical modeling and presentation. </br></br>

During this time period, I was also diagnosed with breast cancer and completed treatment.  My determination to complete this program and earn my masters fueled my recovery, and I am immensely proud of what I have accomplished.
