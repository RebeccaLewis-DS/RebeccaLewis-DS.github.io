Allow me to fan my feathers and show off the work I have completed as part of my Data Science education.  From 2018-2021, I studied as part of the Masters of Data Science program at Bellvue University completing multiple project demonstrating my abilities in Data Science including research, data wrangling, statistical modeling and presentation. 
During this time period, I was also diagnosed with breast cancer and completed treatment.  My determination to complete this program and earn my masters fueled my recovery and I am immensely proud of what I have accomplished.
